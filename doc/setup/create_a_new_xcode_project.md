## Signing requires a development team

If Xcode shows a "Signing" area with a "Status" alert icon, here's how to solve it.

Xcode may show a message such as "Signing requires a development team. Select a development team in the project editor."

  * In the "Signing" section, choose the "Team" dropdown, and choose your Apple ID.

  * If there's no Apple ID, then you need to add yours: Xcode → Preferences → Accounts → the "+" button → Add Apple ID
